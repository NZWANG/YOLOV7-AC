The codes of various networks were tested in Pytorch 1.7 version or higher versions(a little bit different from 0.8 version in some functions) in Python 3.8 on Ubuntu machines (may need minor changes on Windows). For the comparison models, e.g., EfficientDet, YOLOV5, YOLOV6, retinanet, SSD, etc., more information could be found at the corresponding sub-folders.
